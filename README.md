These reports assessed the performance of various linear, ensemble
and neural networks algorithms, covering a broad range of complexity
and interpret-ability in estimating the effective temperatures of known
objects within GaiaDR3 from observational parameters, as well as to
identify new candidates for high mass, low mass x-ray binaries and
cataclysmic variables from a joint GaiaDR3 and eRASS1 catalogue.
This repository contains all code created, datasets used are referenced within the final report.
